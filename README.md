Using historical returns from the Ken French 25 portfolios, we conducted time-series regressions, the GRS-F joint alpha test, and the Fama–MacBeth cross-sectional test (with Shanken corrections). The project output includes a detailed Excel workbook and written analysis, enabling replication and real-time diagnostics across custom time windows.
