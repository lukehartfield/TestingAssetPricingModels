We built a **fully functional Python framework** to evaluate the performance of two major asset pricing models:

- The **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**
- The **Fama–French Three-Factor Model (FF3F)**

Using historical returns from the **Ken French 25 portfolios**, we conducted **time-series regressions**, the **GRS-F joint alpha test**, and the **Fama–MacBeth cross-sectional test** (with **Shanken corrections**). The project output includes a detailed Excel workbook and written analysis, enabling replication and real-time diagnostics across custom time windows.
